## Welcome to the Abel org used for all things GitHub 👋

In this organization you will find test repositories used to demo the functionalities in scope for various trainings.


:bulb: Some of the repositories are configured as templates, so that you can use them in a different organization or in your user account. Some repositories are just tests and not in use for every training. 🍿

:bow: Thank you for following the **Cleanup** steps described in the `README`'s if you followed along in this repository!
